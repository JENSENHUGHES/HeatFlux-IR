# MEASURING HEAT FLUX FROM A FIRE TO A SURFACE USING IR THERMOGRAPHY 

A method was developed to measure full-field, transient heat flux from a fire onto a surface using inverse heat transfer analysis and surface temperatures from an infrared (IR) thermal imaging camera.  Full-field, transient heat flux needs to be quantified to accurately predict temperature rise of surfaces during a fire exposure.  The method was demonstrated through a series of tests with direct fire exposures onto horizontal and vertical stainless steel plates coated with high temperature black paint. Inverse analysis was performed using a two-dimensional finite discretization with no through thickness temperature gradient.  Heat flux measurements obtained from IR thermography using the inverse technique were within one standard deviation of those measured using a Schmidt-Boelter gauge.  Limitations of the measurement were numerically and experimentally investigated and it was found that the precision of the heat flux measurement decreases with increasing spatial and temporal resolution.
